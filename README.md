## Student Depression Analysis Project

This project analyzes a dataset of student responses to identify factors contributing to depression and suicidal thoughts. The analysis explores various parameters such as age, gender, financial stress, dietary habits, and more to understand their correlation with mental health. Key insights include:

- **Depression Rate**: Calculated to measure the prevalence of depression among students.  
- **Suicidal Thoughts**: 85.4% of depressed students reported experiencing suicidal thoughts.  
- **Impact of Financial Stress**: A strong correlation was observed between financial stress levels and depression rates.  
- **Data Visualization**: Created compelling visualizations in Power BI to highlight insights and trends.  

This project aims to provide data-driven insights to inform strategies for improving student mental health support systems.
